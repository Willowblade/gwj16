## Godot Jam Template


The jam template is built to facilitate building jam games by providing 
a lot of batteries to get a game up and running.

Most important in this is:
* A base folder structure to get started quick for all parties involved.
* A menu with start screen.
* A working and easily usable audio engine.
* A base for in-game UI 

Optional:
* Game templates to not have to mess around with base mechanics but start with implementing unique mechanics faster



### Included:

* AudioEngine
* Globals:
    * Game state:
        * GameState
        * Inventory
    * Game flow:

        * Transitions
* UI 
* Menu to start the game


* Game templates:

### TODO:

* Add export templates and CLI for autozip, maybe integrate with itch's butler.
