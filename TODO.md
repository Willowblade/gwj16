# TODO

* [DONE] Make interactions direction based (for the transition between levels, for example)
* [DONE] Preserve direction after navigation
* Make dialogue
* Make an inventory

# Notes

* Note that dialogue has no portrait anymore, or nametag, so the characters will have to introduce themselves.
